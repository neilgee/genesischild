#GenesisChild

This is a basic starter **GenesisChild Theme** to be used with the **Genesis Framework** on **WordPress**.

There is also a Mobile First version of this starter theme (Which is the one I prefer to use)- https://github.com/neilgee/genesischild-mobile-first

This Genesischild theme has a number of widgets areas, some Front Page only.

###Widgetised Areas
- The theme contains the following widgets
* Pre-Header Left
* Pre-Header Right
* Header Right
* Hero - Home Page only *front-page.php*
* Optin - Home Page only *front-page.php*
* Home Top - Home Page only *front-page.php*
* Home Middle - Home Page only *front-page.php*
* Home Bottom - Home Page only *front-page.php*
* Before Content *posts only*
* After Content *posts only*
* Footer Widget Header
* Footer Widgets 1, 2, 3
* Footer
* Post Footer Left
* Post Footer Right

###Home Page
The Home Page has been widgetized and the default Genesis loop can be removed.


To remove the Genesis home page loop tweak the **front-page.php** file by uncommenting line 88:
```php
gc_genesis_no_content();
```

and commenting line 90:
```php
//genesis();
```

###Example
For an online visual:
http://themes.wpbeaches.com/genesischild/
Areas are highlighted to show boundaries and full width wraps these colors are commented out in the CSS.
Only difference is the main home page 3 modules are now stacked in the theme, Home Top, Home Middle and Home Bottom.

###Menus
- Primary Menu is positioned in Header Right Widget Hook and set to Primary Location
- Secondary Menu remains in default area and is Secondary Location
- Responsive menu is added but not enabled, to enable it uncomment in *functions.php* line 39 *	// include_once( get_stylesheet_directory() . '/includes/responsive-menu.php' );*

###Custom Logo
- Custom Logo is supported via the Customizer, suggested size is 400x150px which you can change in the *add_theme_support('custom-logo')* array in *functions.php*
- The header logo  uses an `<img>` element and can support the SVG format.

###Background Image
- Background Images is supported, a background image can be uploaded in the WP Dashboard via Appearance > Background, this will scale to fit any viewport via BackStretchJS.

To use this you have to enable the BackStretch script in */includes/scripts-styles.php* at line 54
